🤖 How the Bot Works

📝 User Input

Type your message in the input box (#typing-area).

Hit Enter or click Send to submit your message.

💬 Displaying Your Message

Your message appears in a blue bubble (user-bubble) in the chat area (#msg_area).

Input box clears automatically after sending.

🤖 Bot Responses

The bot has a set of predefined replies (botReplies).

After 1 second, the bot responds in a pink bubble (bot-bubble).

Each message is sent one by one, using botIndex++ to go to the next reply.

Example replies:

"Hello👋"

"Main badhiya, tum kaise ho? 😎"

"Waah, interesting! 😂😂"

⌨️ Enter Key Support

Press Enter and the message sends automatically—no need to click the button every time.

⚡ Bonus Fun

You can customize botReplies with your own fun messages or emojis to make the chat more lively!
